An algorithm developed for counting words from documents in Python using pandas and textract. REGex pattern is tweaked to identify Latin characters all together (such as enzyme, protein names)

Our test data consists of 10 examples articles (Articles folder). We can identify word combinations written with dash, e.g. deep-learning, real-value... Also enzyme names such as É‘-secretase, beta-secretase etc. (composed of Latin letters).

I want to develop this algorithm into a web aplication.
